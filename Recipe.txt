	•	8 pork sausages
	•	1 tablespoon vegetable oil
	•	225g (8 oz) plain flour
	•	4 eggs
	•	250ml (8 fl oz) milk
	•	salt and pepper to taste
+Step 1 Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C /gas mark 6.
+Step 2 Pour the oil into the bottom of a baking dish, and arrange the sausages over it in a single layer. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven.
+Step 3 Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs and half of the milk until smooth. Gradually mix in the rest of the milk until a smooth batter is achieved. Season with salt and pepper.
+Step 4 Remove the sausages from the oven, and ladle the batter over them until the sausages are 3/4 covered. Return to the oven, and bake for 35 minutes, or until the centre is risen and browned. Don't worry if the underside seems slightly soft, as this is normal.
